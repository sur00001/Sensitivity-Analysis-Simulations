# Sensitivity-Analysis-Simulations

"No PMM and Normal Outcome Simulations" and  "PMM and count outcome simulations" folders has the R-code functions for each part of the simulation (Simulation models for data generation, data generation function, missingness logit models, multiple imputation function and analysis functions (timing and for regime means)). The "Main" file is where you set the simulation parameters. The main file reads in functions from the other code files and runs the simulation in parallel. 

The "No PMM and Normal Outcome Simulations" folder has my new code with simplified models and normal outcomes (log binge drinking). There is an error in these files - most likely in the data generation and induce missingness R files. 

See the data generating mechanism pdf in this repository for more details!
